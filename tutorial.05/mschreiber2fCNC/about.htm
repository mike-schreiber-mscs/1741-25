                  <p>Mike Schreiber, owner of  Schreiber Custom CNC Routing, started  in the sheet metal fabrication industry 22 years ago.  It all began with operating CNC                     equipment in sheet metal fab shops. After 11 years of experience in CNC machine operation, he moved into the engineering side of manufacturing where he                     programmed CNC machines such as router, waterjet, and turret punch to name a few. Also in the mix was new equipment implementation and  manufacturing process                     improvement practices. In 2007, Mike joined a CAD/CAM  Software company where he acquired industry knowledge while  supporting customers in a software                     application engineer role. During this time he also conducted onsite software training to customers. In 2013 he completed the ISTQB (International Software                     Testing Qualifications Board) Certification Certified Tester Foundation Level. This brings us to 2015 when Mike moved  forward on an idea to apply some of that                     manufacturing knowledge and  start up Schreiber Custom CNC Routing. Mike having 20 plus years of CNC experience coupled with the knowledge of  the latest in                     CAD/CAM technology, you can be assured to get the highest of detail, accuracy, and design for your project needs.
