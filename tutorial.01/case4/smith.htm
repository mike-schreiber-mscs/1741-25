                <h2>Overview</h2>
                
            	<p>Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400
				   leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
				   LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated
			       with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
				   for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points
				   can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
			       range of motion.</p>
                   
                 <p>You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
				    basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
				    lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
 				    to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
				    The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates</p>
                    
                 <p>The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
				    access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
				    do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a wall and you're ready
				    to go!</p>

                  <ul>
                  	<li><strong>Smooth Smith Action:</strong> The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings
						alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful workouts,

                    <li><strong>Proper Angle:</strong> The bar travels along a 7 degree path from vertical. Studies have
						shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
						prevent injury.</li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at 
						any point in your workout routine.</li>
